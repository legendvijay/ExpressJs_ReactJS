Sample Snippet for

Using ReactJs code in Express.Js
And get it using ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<componetname/>);

React Components are located in /pages
------ npm run-script build ------
will generate normal JS files in /Lib
and they will be used in express code by using ReactDOMServer.renderToString


Its just a sample using Babel 
please check package.json & .babelrc files if you are new to babel and its config setting and presets.


I created this sample in Visual Studio but can be usefull from any IDE.. {dont forgot to run 'npm install'}
